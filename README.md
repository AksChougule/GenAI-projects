# Generative AI experiments

This is a collection of experiments to explore, try and learn about various generative AI technologies.

Each directory is a standalone usecase.

- advanced-RAG: Building better RAG using LlamaIndex with sentence-window retrieval and auto-merging retrieva
- experiment-tracking: Learning to try to track multiple experiment with models, context, chunck size etc. Also defining your own custom evaluation metrics.
- gorilla: WIP (learning to use tools/API calls with gorilla framework)  
- GPT4turbo-w-vision: Testing OpenAI's GPT4 with vision API
- linkedin-post-generator: Langchain framework application to build a project which can write a linkedin post if you give it a topic. It can create post tile, text and hashtags.
- pandas-df-agent: Partially successful attempt to build a tabular data query engine using LLM
- localGPT: Setting up llama-cpp on your local machine which enable access to quantized models.
- local-GPT-experiment
- pet-name-generator
- pdf-qa-w-llama
- yt-transcript-generator: Langchain application example (includes prompt templates, chains, agents, streamlite demo)
