      "A. CAR Construct  90 \n",
      " 91 \n",
      "CAR s generally contain two types of  domains : antigen recognition and signaling.  92 \n",

       " Document(page_content='Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  \\n \\n5 D. Long T erm Follow -up for Novel Gene Therapy Products  \\n \\nNovel GT products developed as a result of emerging technologies , such as transposon-\\nbased gene insertion and genome editing , also raise concerns for delayed adverse events \\ndue to the unique genome modifying activity of such products.  Specifically, a vector \\nwith a transposon element  can insert transgenes into the host chromosome randomly by a \\ndirect “cut -and-paste” mechanism, mediated by the transposases (enzy me) activity in the \\nproduct ( Ref. 20).  A GT product with genome  editing components can give rise to non-\\nspecific off -target change s in the genome ( Ref. 2), and may be associated with unknown \\nand unpredictable risks for developing delayed adverse events in study subjects  and \\npatients ( once approved ), the extent of whic h will vary depending on the targeting \\nmechanisms accompanying thes e components .  The LTFU observations for these novel \\nGT products should be designed to tak e into account product -specific characteristics, the \\nbasic and translational knowledge generated in  the field, and the product -specific \\npreclinical data generated to enable investigation al new drug application ( IND) studies, \\nas described in the following section.  \\n  IV. PRECLINICAL DATA USED FOR ASSESS MENT OF DELAYED RISK S IN \\nGENE THERAPY CLINICAL TRIALS  \\n \\nA. Framework  to Assess Potential Delayed Risks of Gene Therapy Prod ucts \\n \\nTo assess the risk of delayed adverse events for a GT product, w e recommend that you \\nuse available preclinical and clinical evidence, and current information about your product and similar products based on studies that you and others have performed.  In \\ngeneral, when the risk of delayed adverse events is low  following exposure to a GT \\nproduct, LTFU observations are not recommended.  We consider the assessment of risk to be a continuous process; a s more data accumulates, we recommend that you reasses s \\nthe risk to your subjects and, if appropriate,  revise your existing  LTFU observations \\nstudy protocol or initiate a LTFU observations  study protocol , if previously allowed to \\nproceed without an LTFU observations  study protocol .  \\n Preclinical and clinical experience with your product or similar products may be  \\nconsidered relevant in the assess ment of the risk for delayed adverse events.  For \\nexample, experience with G T products in the same vector type\\n5, administered by a \\nsimilar route, or  given for the same clinical indication may contribute helpful \\ninformation . However, for novel products such information may not be available  or \\napplicable, or may be limited, in which  case data from well -designed preclinical studies \\n(as described in section IV .B of this doc ument ) should be used in assessing the risk of \\ndelayed adverse events.   Primary data  and information  relevant to the assessment of the \\nrisk of delayed events should be submitted  in your IND along with other preclinical data \\n(see 21 CFR 312.23(a)(8), 312.23(a) (10)(iv), and 312.23(a) (11)).  \\n \\n                                                 \\n5 See Table 1 for examples of vector types.
